== Running the service
Playground Payroll Services is written using http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot[Spring Boot] which
makes it easy to get it up and running so that you can start exploring the REST API.

The first step is to clone the Git repository:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/davidshue/payroll-services.git
----

Once the clone is complete, you're ready to get the service up and running:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd {project_workspace}/payroll-services
$ mvn clean package
$ java -jar target/*.jar
----

You can check that the service is up and running by executing a simple request using
cURL:

include::{snippets}/home/curl-request.adoc[]

This request should yield the following response

include::{snippets}/home/http-response.adoc[]


You can hit the service in the browser by
(e.g)localhost:8080/ws/v2/payroll(?day=2016-08-01)
request param day should have the format of yyyy-dd-MM, check the data
